# mt63_wasm

This is very much a work in progress; the idea is to compile a mt63 library to wasm
using emscripten to allow encoding MT63 messages and "sending" them from an HTML5 audio
web application; this could be used to reliably transmit data from a smartphone app
across Amateur Radio FM signals on VHF/UHF.

# Release notes

* 1.5.0 - Add support for downsampling in WASM code
* 1.4.0 - Rebuild using a newer more optimized version of emscripten
* 1.3.3 - Misc updates to allow customization of the emscripten load Module
* 1.2.2 - Fixed broken wasm binary on iOS 

# Preparing to build

You need emscripten and cmake installed and in your path -- it will try to use `emcmake` to set up the build directory

# Building

Once that's done, building is a simple two-step process:

    ./prepemscripten.sh
    cmake --build build/

You should now have a build/ directory.  Copy index.html into the build/ directory and run some sort of static web server there.  I use node-static: `npm install -g node-static`. If you have node-static installed you can start a server like so:

    cd build/
    static .

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser, open a console, and run `sendMessage("This is a test message");` You should hear the mt63 come through.

# Status

This is being used by the Runner-tracker app. To use, do something like this:

    /// <reference types="webassembly-js-api" />
    // The above is to get types for WebAssembly -- fix this however works for you

    // tslint:disable:no-var-imports
    // tslint:disable:no-var-requires

    import {
        setFileLocation,
        initialize,
        MT63Client,
    } from 'mt63-wasm';

    import {
        wasmModule,
    } from 'mt63-wasm/dist/wasmModule';

    const wasmFile = require("mt63-wasm/dist/mt63Wasm.wasm");

    setFileLocation("mt63Wasm.wasm", wasmFile);
    export const readyDfd = initialize();

    export {MT63Client, wasmModule};

You may need to update your webpack config to override the type for
the webassembly file to "javascript/auto" and use "file-loader" to
load it to make this work. Our vue.config.js file looks like this:

    module.exports = {
        publicPath: process.env.GITLAB_CI ? '/runner-tracker/' : '/',
        chainWebpack: config => {
            config.module
                .rule('wasm')
                .test(/\.wasm$/)
                .type("javascript/auto")
                .use('file-loader')
                    .loader('file-loader');
        }
    };


# Shameless plugs

This project relies heavily on the fldigi MT63 code and was put together by Richard Bateman, founder of HamStudy.org. To support our efforts, check out https://signalstuff.com/antennas (our main source of funding) and https://hamstudy.org/appstore for well engineered study apps for only $3.99. HamStudy.org is sponsored by Icom, which means that in a round-about sort of way Icom also sponsors this project =] They really
do a lot to build the ham radio community in the US so support them in whatever ways you can!
